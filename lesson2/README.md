# Lesson 2: Using `lin`s to define other `lin`s

In Lesson 1, we got familiar with NanoRGL. You may have added new language(s), new lexicon or constructions as an exercise -- cool if you did, cool if you didn't. In this directory, we have a fresh copy of NanoRGL that will be used in an application grammar. (How to use a grammar from another directory is a topic for a later lesson.)

So far we've seen a clear division of labour between `abstract` and `concrete` vs. `resource` modules, as well as `fun`s and `lin`s vs `oper`s.

You've learned so far that you can open a `resource` in `concrete` and use

You have a concrete syntax know how to open a resource module full of `oper`s, and use those `oper`s
Here I present a new concept: using `lin`s to define other `lin`s
