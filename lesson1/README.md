# Lesson 1: NanoRGL

This is the absolute minimum meaningful syntax I could think of: nouns and determiners that make a noun phrase. Read my [blog post](TODO) for more explanations.

Suggestions for tasks:

* Write a concrete syntax for a new language
* Add something to the abstract syntax: for instance, adjectives ("big dog"), more nouns, other determiners ("my dog", "5 dogs").
