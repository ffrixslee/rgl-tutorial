# Lesson 1: NanoRGL

This is the absolute minimum meaningful syntax I could think of: nouns and determiners that make a noun phrase. This is almost, but not quite, a subset of the real RGL abstract syntax.

Read my [blog post](TODO) for more explanations.

### (Optional) tasks for lesson 1

You don't need to do these in order to understand the rest of the tutorial, but I'm hoping it would be fun for you to do it.

* Make a concrete syntax for a new language
* Add something to the abstract syntax: for instance, adjectives ("big dog"), more nouns, other determiners ("my dog", "5 dogs").
