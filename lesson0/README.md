# Lesson 0: Using RGL in an application

This is the baseline to make sure you understand the rest of the tutorial. I expect you to

1. Take a look at the abstract (`Example`) and concrete (`ExampleEng`) syntax in this directory.
2. Make sure that ExampleEng.gf compiles on your computer. If not, that's a sign that you haven't set up `GF_LIB_PATH` correctly. (See [instructions](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/~inari/gf-windows.html#toc3) if you're on Windows.)
3. Note that you find the grammar absolutely trivial and uninteresting. You understand where each `oper` comes from, and could easily write a similar grammar yourself, both abstract and concrete syntax. Consulting the RGL API or other GF documentation is fine, but you wouldn't need to ask a human for help.

If point 3 is true, you can proceed to lesson 1.

If you do not understand the concrete syntax, I recommend to work through the [GF tutorial](TODO) lessons 1-3 completely, and lesson 4 from the beginning, but you can stop when you see the word _functor_ for the first time. That's your cue for "I've learned enough, time to go back to this tutorial!"
